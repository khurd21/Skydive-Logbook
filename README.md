# Skydive-Logbook

## Introduction

Cloud Log is a web application that
allows skydivers to log their jumps and view their jump history.
This project was created to address the need for a simple, easy to use
web application that allows skydivers to log their jumps and view their
jump history. Additionally, humans are forgetful and lose track of
their physical logbooks. That's no fun! Put your logbook in the cloud with
Cloud Log!
